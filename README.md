### Hi there üëã <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Alex, here's a story about how I learned how ugly webpages are; when I was a child, i think about 10 or 11 I got into coding when i refreshed a webpage, i think it was craigslist, anyway when i saw how it loaded into blue links and just text I was like "this is ugly" after it loaded the CSS it was easier to navigate. For a long time I didn't know where to start, one day after going out in search for better opportunited I discovered online recources and communities that are built by bootcamps and schools that peak peoples drive for learning code. devs are one of the most diverse skillset in the world. I love life knowing Devs help ease life.
